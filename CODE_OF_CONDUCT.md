# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of the GlassSurf community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- **Be Respectful:** Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be aware of your impact and how intense online discussions can be.

- **Be Inclusive:** Seek input from all perspectives, consider and acknowledge other peopleâ€™s feelings, culture, and skills. Be aware of your own biases and work to mitigate them. Make a conscious effort to include people who might otherwise be excluded.

- **Be Collaborative:** Work together! We all share the same goals, and collaboration helps achieve them. Share your knowledge and experience. Help others learn and grow.

- **Be Mindful of Your Language:** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- **Violence and Threats of Violence:** You may not threaten violence or any kind of physical harm to another member, guest, or individual.

- **Sexual Language and Imagery:** Sexually explicit or violent material may not be shared.

- **Personal Attacks:** Do not engage in personal attacks. Critique ideas, not people. Your tone should match the way you would speak in person.

- **Derogatory Comments:** Do not insult, demean, or belittle others.

- **Unwelcome Attention or Stalking:** Do not engage in unwelcome attention or stalking. This includes, but is not limited to, sustained disruption of discussions.

- **Hateful Language:** Hate speech is not tolerated. Do not use language that is offensive towards specific groups of people.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [glass.surf.report@protonmail.com]. All reports will be kept confidential.

## Consequences

We will not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. When we receive a complaint, we will review and take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, including a warning, expulsion from the community, or legal action.
